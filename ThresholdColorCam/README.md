This digital mirror is a colorful way to change the output of your webcam. The mirror has a ‘Pop Art’ style with its reduced detail and blocks of color. The camera has three color settings that can be changed by the user using the keyboard. The default colors are purple and blue, if the ‘B’ key is pressed the colors will shift to black and white, if the ‘R’ key is pressed the colors will shift to red and white, and the default colors will be called back with the ‘P’ key. A screenshot will be captured by pressing the ‘S’ key.
